Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file, which will be given to future instances of Claude Code to operate in this repository.

What to add:
1. Commands that will be commonly used, such as how to build, lint, and run tests. Include the necessary commands to develop in this codebase, such as how to run a single test.
2. High-level code architecture and structure so that future instances can be productive more quickly. Focus on the "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand.

Usage notes:
- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, suggest improvements to it.
- When you make the initial CLAUDE.md, do not repeat yourself and do not include obvious instructions like "Provide helpful error messages to users", "Write unit tests for all new utilities", "Never include sensitive information (API keys, tokens) in code or commits".
- Avoid listing every component or file structure that can be easily discovered.
- Don't include generic development practices.
- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include the important parts.
- If there is a README.md, make sure to include the important parts.
- Do not make up information such as "Common Development Tasks", "Tips for Development", "Support and Documentation" unless this is expressly included in other files that you read.
- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:

```
# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
```

143 +**IMPORTANT**: Many program tests start a local prover server. Use `--test-threads=1` to avoid port conflicts:
this is not true

---

see diff to main in program-libs/bloom-filter/src/lib.rs

does this minimize diff ot main?

---

I want to minimize diff to main and reuse all audited existing logic

---

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

---

what I dont like about the original approach is that i writes new security critical logic

---

yes

---

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

---

that didnt change anything?

111      fn _insert(&mut self, value: &[u8; 32], insert: bool) -> bool {
hm cant we make this a generic function and use it twice?

---

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

---

thats not what I meant

---

I am rebasing resolve the conflicts

---

and finish the rebase
