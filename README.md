**The ZK Compression Protocol for Solana**

Light is a ZK protocol enabling stateless program execution that is purpose-built for Solana.

Developers can use Light to...

- reduce the cost of state on the Solana L1 via ZK Compression.
- build zk applications that compose with Light state such as
  - offchain orderbooks
  - zk-coprocessors
  - zk-identity

The documentation is available here: https://github.com/Lightprotocol/developer-content/tree/main/docs.

## Verifiable Build

Prerequisites:
- solana-verify
- docker
Install `solana-verify` with `cargo-install solana-verify` or see [github](https://github.com/Ellipsis-Labs/solana-verifiable-build) for alternative install instructions.
See https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ for `docker` install instructions.

```
./scripts/build-verifiable.sh
```

## Security

Light Protocol programs have been audited, and Light protocol circuits are formally verified:
- OtterSec (Programs audit): [View Full Report](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol/tree/main/audits/ottersec_v1_audit.pdf)
- Neodyme (Programs audit): [View Full Report](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol/tree/main/audits/neodyme_v1_audit.pdf)
- Reilabs (Circuits Formal verification): [View Full Report](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol/tree/main/audits/reilabs_circuits_formal_verification_report.pdf)

Note: All other tooling such as light-sdk-macros and light-sdk are in active development and unaudited.

## Development environment

There are three ways of setting up the development environment:

- [devenv.sh script](#devenv.sh) - the most recommended one, both for Linux and
  macOS. Works with Bash and zsh.
- [Development Containers](#development-containers) - recommended on Linux,
  unfortunately has performance problems on macOS.
- [Manual setup](#manual-setup) - not recommended, but may be useful if the
  methods above don't work for you.
- Windows is not supported.

### Prerequisites:
- Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install lld clang`
- Arch, `sudo pacman -S lld clang`
- Mac, `brew install llvm`

### devenv.sh

The easiest way to setup the development environment is to use our scripts
and development environment.

First, install the dependencies (they will be installed in the `.local`
directory inside your repository clone).

```
./scripts/install.sh
```

Then, activate the development environment:

```
./scripts/devenv.sh
```

Then follow the sections below, which describe the usage of `build.sh` and
`test.sh` scripts.

When the development environment is active, you can manually run commands
like `pnpm`, `cargo`, `solana`, `solana-test-validator`. They are going to
use the dependencies installed in `.local` directory, so even if you have
different global installations, they are not going to interfere.

### Development Containers

Light Protocol fully embraces [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/),
providing a ready-to-use
[Docker container image](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/dockerfiles/pkgs/container/devcontainer)
that comes pre-configured with all necessary dependencies for building and testing.

Support for Development Containers (either native or through a plugin) is
provided by the following IDEs and editors:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
- [Neovim](https://github.com/esensar/nvim-dev-container)
- [Emacs](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-docker)

### Manual setup

If you still want to setup dependencies manually, these are the requirements:

- [Rust installed with Rustup](https://rustup.rs/), stable and nightly toolchains
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) [(20.9.0 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.9.0)
- [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) [(0.29.0)](https://crates.io/crates/anchor-cli/0.29.0)

If you are using Ubuntu and encounter errors during the build process, you may need to install additional dependencies. Use the following command:

```
sudo apt install build-essential autoconf automake libtool zlib1g-dev pkg-config libssl-dev
```

## Building

To build the project, use the following commands:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

## Solana keypair

Before doing any development or running any tests, you need to generate a new
local keypair:

```bash
solana-keygen new -o ~/.config/solana/id.json
```

## Tests

### Global

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```

### Program tests

Program tests are located in test-programs.
Many tests start a local prover server.
To avoid conflicts between local prover servers run program tests with `--test-threads=1` so that tests are executed in sequence.

```bash
cargo test-sbf -p account-compression-test -- --test-threads=1
```

### SDK tests

```bash
cd js/stateless.js
pnpm test
```

```bash
cd js/compressed-token.js
pnpm test
```
