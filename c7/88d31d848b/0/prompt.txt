396 - 417, Lift the duplicate CreateTokenAtaCpi construction out of the
conditional: inside the atas loop build a single CreateTokenAtaCpi instance
using shared.fee_payer, ata.owner, ata.mint, ata.ata, then if ata.idempotent
call .idempotent() on that instance else keep the base instance, and finally
call .rent_free(compressible_config, rent_sponsor, system_program).invoke()?;
this preserves the type-state flow of CreateTokenAtaCpi ->
CreateTokenAtaCpiIdempotent while removing duplicated struct construction and
keeping .rent_free()/.invoke() applied to the resulting value.

168 - 185, The code constructs a CpiAccounts (via CpiAccounts::new_with_config
and CpiAccountsConfig::new/_with_cpi_context) even when PDAS == 0 and MINTS == 0
and the resulting cpi_accounts is never used by create_token_vaults or
create_atas; avoid the unnecessary validation/slicing by guarding construction:
check the conditions (e.g., if shared.proof.PDAS > 0 || shared.proof.MINTS > 0)
before creating CpiAccounts and only call CpiAccounts::new_with_config when
needed, otherwise skip building cpi_accounts (or make it an Option) and
propagate that to callers so unused allocation/validation is not performed;
refer to symbols CpiAccounts, CpiAccountsConfig, create_token_vaults,
create_atas, remaining_accounts, and shared.proof.system_accounts_offset when
applying the change.

105 - 140, In create_accounts, the pda_setup closure parameter is silently
ignored when the const generic PDAS == 0; add a short runtime/debug assertion
and/or an inline comment just before the PDAS > 0 check to document and assert
this behavior so callers aren’t surprised (reference the create_accounts
function, the pda_setup parameter, and the PDAS const generic); specifically,
add a brief debug_assert or explicit comment indicating “pda_setup is
intentionally not called when PDAS == 0” and consume/drop the closure in that
branch if needed to avoid unused-value warnings.
