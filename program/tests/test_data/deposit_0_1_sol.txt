Chainanalysis proof:
dataset -> include hash of a dataset
every blacklisted address and all connected addresses are leaves of merkle trees
every address with all its connections makes up a merkle tree you prove that your
address is part of a clean sub tree
you stop at addresses of exchanges which are trusted
How do you connect the trees to the whole dataset?
if you input a blacklisted address
