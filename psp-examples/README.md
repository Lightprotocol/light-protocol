# PSP Examples

Collection of custom PSPs (Private Solana Programs) built on top of [Light Protocol v3](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol).

These are reference implementations for Solana Localnet.

Each PSP is bootstrapped using the [Light CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lightprotocol/cli) and leverages Light's [zk.js](https://npmjs.com/package/@lightprotocol/zk.js) on the client. 

We'll add more examples over time and keep these up to date with the latest changes.

If you're looking for an example that uses zk.js for simple token transfers without a custom PSP, see [./private-payments](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/psp-examples/tree/main/private-payments)
