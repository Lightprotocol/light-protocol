# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a TypeScript implementation of the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game is built on the Solana blockchain and is bootstrapped using the [Light CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lightprotocol/cli) (which also leverages the Anchor framework).  

It uses [Light Protocol v3](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol) for private state and state transitions. This allows the game to be played fully on-chain without the drawbacks of transparent game state (e.g. cheating by looking up the other player's choice or hand on-chain)

This example also serves as a demonstration of how any kind of turn-based game can be implemented on Solana where a hybrid private/public game state becomes necessary.


## Game Logic

The game logic is encapsulated in the Game and Player classes.

- Game class: This class represents a single game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. It includes methods for creating a game, joining a game, and determining the winner of a game.

- Player class: This class represents a player in the game. It includes methods for initializing a player, creating a game, joining a game, executing a game, and closing a game PDA.

## Game Flow

1. Player 1 creates a game by choosing Rock, Paper, or Scissors and the amount of Solana tokens to bet.

2. Player 2 joins the game by providing the game commitment hash, their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the same amount of Solana tokens.

3. The game is executed, and the winner is determined based on the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.

4. The game is closed, and the winner receives the total bet amount.

## Test Cases

The code includes test cases for the three possible outcomes of a game: Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, or a draw.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:
– node.js, yarn
- circom
- rust
- cargo-expand (```cargo install cargo-expand```)
- solana-cli >= 1.16.4

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

2. Build circuits:
```
yarn build
```

3. Execute the test suite using the following command:
```bash
yarn test
```
